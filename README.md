# nDDims
MATLAB MultiDimensional Dictionary class

My work-in-progress class for implementing Python-esque dictionaries in MATLAB. 

This is a work in progress. The core code is implemented, but documentation is missing. I will be updating it more over the coming months.

nDDims is similar to the multidimensional map function implemented by David Young. However, this implementation does not use MATLAB maps containers and instead just adds functionality to traditional MATLAB matrices and cell arrays.
